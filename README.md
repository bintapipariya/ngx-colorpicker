# Angular 2 Color Picker

<a href="https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-colorpicker"><img src="https://badge.fury.io/js/ngx-colorpicker.svg" align="right" alt="npm version" height="18"></a>

This is an AOT compatible version of the cool ngx-colorpicker by Alberplz.

In future this library might merge with the ngx-colorpicker or continue live as a seprate library.

More info about library usage see the README of the ngx-colorpicker for now.

See a live example application <a href="https://dharmeshpipariya.github.io/ngx-colorpicker/">here</a>.
